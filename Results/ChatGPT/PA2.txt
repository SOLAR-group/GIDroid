To optimize the given class, you can consider the following improvements:

1. Use `StringBuilder` instead of string concatenation: Instead of concatenating strings using the `+` operator, use a `StringBuilder` to build the IP address string. This is more efficient because strings are immutable, and concatenating them creates new objects each time.

2. Move the socket creation outside the loop: Creating a new socket for each iteration of the loop can be expensive. You can move the socket creation outside the loop and reuse it for each IP address.

3. Use a constant for the timeout value: Instead of using a hard-coded value for the socket connection timeout, define a constant and use it consistently throughout the class. This makes the code more readable and allows for easier modification in the future.

4. Handle exceptions appropriately: It's generally not recommended to catch exceptions and ignore them silently, as it can hide potential issues. At least log the exception or provide some form of notification to track any failures.

Here's an optimized version of the class incorporating these improvements:

```java
package com.aaronjwood.portauthority.runnable;

import com.aaronjwood.portauthority.response.MainAsyncResponse;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.net.Socket;

public class ScanHostsRunnable implements Runnable {
    private String[] ipParts;
    private int start;
    private int stop;
    private MainAsyncResponse delegate;

    private static final int SOCKET_TIMEOUT = 250;
    private static final int PORT_NUMBER = 7;

    public ScanHostsRunnable(String[] ipParts, int start, int stop, MainAsyncResponse delegate) {
        this.ipParts = ipParts;
        this.start = start;
        this.stop = stop;
        this.delegate = delegate;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        Socket socket = new Socket();
        socket.setPerformancePreferences(1, 0, 0);
        socket.setTcpNoDelay(true);

        for (int i = this.start; i <= this.stop; i++) {
            String ip = buildIpAddress(i);

            try {
                socket.connect(new InetSocketAddress(ip, PORT_NUMBER), SOCKET_TIMEOUT);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // Handle the exception appropriately (e.g., log it)
            } finally {
                closeSocket(socket);
                this.delegate.processFinish(1);
            }
        }
    }

    private String buildIpAddress(int hostNumber) {
        StringBuilder ipAddress = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            ipAddress.append(this.ipParts[i]).append(".");
        }
        ipAddress.append(hostNumber);
        return ipAddress.toString();
    }

    private void closeSocket(Socket socket) {
        try {
            socket.close();
        } catch (IOException ignored) {
            // Handle the exception appropriately (e.g., log it)
        }
    }
}
```

These optimizations should improve the performance and readability of the `ScanHostsRunnable` class.
