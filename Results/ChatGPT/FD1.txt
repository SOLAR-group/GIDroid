To optimize the given class, you can consider the following improvements:

1. Remove unused imports: Remove any unused import statements to declutter the code and improve readability.

2. Minimize the use of static variables: Reduce the use of static variables as they can lead to potential concurrency issues and make the code harder to test and maintain. Instead, consider using instance variables or passing variables as method parameters where appropriate.

3. Optimize theme-related methods: The `applyTheme`, `applyDialogTheme`, and `setSecureWindow` methods can be refactored to eliminate duplicate code and improve readability. Consider combining these methods into a single method that takes a theme parameter and handles the necessary operations based on the theme.

4. Improve exception handling: Instead of catching and throwing IOException in the `getMirror` method, consider using a custom exception type that provides more specific information about the error. This can help with better error handling and debugging.

5. Optimize image loading: The usage of the Universal Image Loader library can be improved by utilizing the newer version and optimizing the configuration for better performance. Additionally, consider using more efficient alternatives like Glide or Picasso for image loading.

6. Review ACRA integration: If the ACRA library is not essential for the application, you can consider removing it to simplify the codebase and reduce overhead.

7. Simplify the initialization logic: Review the initialization logic in the `onCreate` method and refactor it if necessary. Ensure that any costly operations are only performed when necessary and consider moving some of the logic to separate methods or classes to improve modularity and maintainability.

8. Apply coding conventions: Ensure that the code follows consistent coding conventions, such as proper indentation, naming conventions, and comments. This will make the code easier to read and maintain.

9. Refactor and modularize: Analyze the class's responsibilities and consider extracting separate classes or methods for specific functionality. This will help improve the overall structure and make the code easier to understand and maintain.

Remember to test the code after making any optimizations to ensure that it still functions correctly.
