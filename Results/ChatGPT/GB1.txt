To optimize the `renderWidgets()` method, you can consider the following improvements:

1. Move the initialization of `circleBitmap` outside the conditional block:
   Instead of creating the `circleBitmap` inside the `if (drawCircles)` block, move its initialization outside the block to avoid redundant bitmap creation. This will reduce unnecessary object creation in each iteration of the loop.

2. Use a single loop for iterating through widgets:
   Instead of using a loop to iterate through `this.widgets` and another loop for `widget.getElements()`, combine them into a single loop. This will eliminate the need for multiple iterations and simplify the code.

3. Avoid repetitive file existence checks:
   Instead of checking for file existence multiple times, you can check it once before the loop for `widget.getElements()` and skip the iteration if the file doesn't exist.

4. Reuse BitmapFactory options:
   Create a `BitmapFactory.Options` instance and reuse it for decoding image files. This allows you to set options such as inSampleSize to reduce memory usage if required.

5. Use a StringBuilder for logging messages:
   Instead of concatenating strings in the logging statements, use a `StringBuilder` to improve performance and reduce memory overhead.

Here's the optimized version of the `renderWidgets()` method:

```java
private void renderWidgets() {
    Prefs prefs = new Prefs(GBApplication.getDeviceSpecificSharedPrefs(getDeviceSupport().getDevice().getAddress()));
    boolean forceWhiteBackground = prefs.getBoolean("force_white_color_scheme", false);
    boolean drawCircles = prefs.getBoolean("widget_draw_circles", false);

    Bitmap circleBitmap = null;
    if (drawCircles) {
        circleBitmap =
