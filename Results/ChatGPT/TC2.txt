To optimize the given methods, here are some suggestions:

1. `getLastMeasurement()`:
   - Instead of retrieving all measurements from the database and selecting the last one, you can modify the query to retrieve only the last measurement directly from the database using the `MAX` function on the timestamp column. This will reduce the amount of data transferred from the database to the application.

2. `getAllMeasurementsCount()`:
   - Instead of querying the entire table and counting the rows, you can use a more efficient approach by executing a `COUNT(*)` query directly on the table. This will give you the count without retrieving the actual data, which can be faster for large tables.

3. `getMeasurementsStatistics()`:
   - The method involves multiple subqueries and joins, which can be optimized to reduce the number of database queries. You can consider restructuring the query to perform the necessary calculations in a single query without the need for intermediate subqueries. This can improve the overall performance of the method.

4. `getAnalyticsStatistics()`:
   - Similar to `getMeasurementsStatistics()`, you can optimize the query to calculate the required statistics in a single query. Consider combining the subqueries and aggregations to fetch the necessary information efficiently.

5. `getLocationBounds()`:
   - The method retrieves the minimum and maximum latitude and longitude values from the locations table. You can add appropriate indexes on the latitude and longitude columns to speed up the query. Additionally, ensure that you have an index on the table's primary key to optimize the retrieval of the single row.

6. `getOlderMeasurements()`:
   - The method retrieves older measurements based on a maximum timestamp. To optimize this, create an index on the timestamp column to speed up the retrieval of older measurements. Additionally, you can consider optimizing the query by using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` for pagination instead of retrieving all the measurements and skipping the offset manually.

7. `getMeasurements()` (private method):
   - You can review the query and make sure that appropriate indexes are added to the relevant columns used in the joins and the WHERE clause. Indexes can significantly improve the performance of database queries.

These are general optimization suggestions, and the actual impact on performance may vary depending on the specific database structure, data volume, and usage patterns. It's recommended to profile the application and analyze the query execution plans to identify any further optimizations.
